# Enrollment and Trial Generation Description

## For Academic Paper

We construct the speaker verification protocol following standard practices in speaker recognition research. For each speaker in the dataset, we partition their utterances into two disjoint sets: enrollment utterances and trial candidate utterances. Specifically, we randomly sample 15% of each speaker's utterances (with a fixed random seed for reproducibility) to serve as enrollment data. These enrollment utterances are used to build speaker-specific voiceprint models during the enrollment phase. The remaining 85% of utterances are designated as trial candidates, which are used exclusively for evaluation and are strictly separated from the enrollment data to prevent data leakage.

The trial list is generated by pairing each target speaker with all candidate utterances. For each speaker-utterance pair, we assign a binary label: "target" if the utterance belongs to the target speaker, or "nontarget" if it belongs to a different speaker. This creates a comprehensive evaluation set consisting of both positive trials (target speaker's own utterances) and negative trials (utterances from other speakers), enabling the computation of standard speaker verification metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER) and Detection Cost Function (DCF).

The protocol is further stratified by speaker gender, generating separate trial lists for female and male speakers to enable gender-specific analysis. This design ensures that the evaluation reflects realistic speaker verification scenarios while maintaining strict separation between enrollment and evaluation data.
